👁️ IrisScope – AI Powered Iris Disease Prediction

IrisScope is an AI-assisted decision-support application designed to analyze human iris images for early risk indication of potential eye conditions. The system performs sector-wise iris analysis by studying colour variations, contour deviations, and pattern irregularities, combined with user-reported symptoms.
